# What is it
This is a mock company website that I made in 2018 using the skills I'd aqquired from my high school computer science class. It was originally made in Brackets using strictly html and CSS, but now that I'm a little more experienced, I may fix up the site. The main function of the site that I spent the most time on was it's homepage. I had a orange themed collage of images that took up the entirety of the screen but when your mouse hovered over an image it changed to a different image. As you can imagine, this was a very tedious process because I had to figure out image sizing and things of that nature. It was a lot of trial and error. This isn't my best work, lol, but I think it's good to give a little glimpse of where I was at during that time. Feel free to look around!!

# Some of the things that I am proud of are:
- The navbar
- The picture collage homepage 
- The logo I made


# Some mistakes that I now see:
- I didn't make the site transportable or flexible (It only showed up perfectly on my machiene)
- Images weren't sourced correctly
- The spacing wasn't well thought out
- The font is unprofessional
